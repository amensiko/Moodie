Title: Moodie (created by combining "mood" and "movie" --> emphasises the meaning of the app).

Team members: Anastasija Mensikova and Ilya Ilyankou.

Elevator Pitch: Are you tired of trying to find a good film to watch every weekend? Then Moodie is the app for you! It picks the best film for you to watch based on your current mood and situation. All you need to do is to answer a few questions about yourself, puck up a few keywords and, voila, the film is picked!

Functional Description: Moodie consists of two main parts: the quiz and the solution. In the first part, the app will provide some questions for the user to answer and keywords to select (e.g. What's your current mood? Choose one word to describe yourself. What kind of film genre are you craving for right now? etc). After that, Moodie will match the user's answer with a few films he/she might want to watch at the moment, and will show them to the user along with a short description for each of them. The user can thereafter use his/her own sources and watch the desired film.

Technical Description: First of all, the app will use user's current location, time and date as some of the factors when matching films (e.g. if the user is in Connecticut and it's November, the app may pick an Autumn-feel movie with a hint of Christmas). Moodie will also be heavily based on IMDb as the source of information on films for its database.

Potential Impacts: After doing some research, we realised that there is no app similar to Moodie that could make people's lives easier simply by picking the right films, because sometimes it is quite a big of a struggle. The biggest impact Moodie will have is it will get rid of some frustration in its users' lives. No noticeable impact on user's privacy will be made.
